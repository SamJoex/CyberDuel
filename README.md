# CyberDuel
A cancelled experimental RPG Battle Simulator. I will likely restart this RPG idea from scratch, after learning how to wield SFML properly.

The code as it's written now works only via terminal, and includes only two things:
(1) A basic damage calculator.
(2) An elemental attack damage calculator (based on the letter power provided).

The available executable likely doesn't work; you'll need to compile the source code in order to get a working copy. At the time of release, I did not know how to get an executable that worked on other systems. Apologies!
